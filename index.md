Hone Heke's response to the Ti Tiriti, also known as the treaty of Waitangi.
Written by Michael

The Treaty of Waitangi officially signed in the bay of islands on February 6th, 1840 is known today as the document which founded NZ and established the relationship between the Maori and the modern government. the treaty promised the Maori that the pakeha wouldn't interfere with their culture delivering equity and protection while in return giving the British the right to govern the land and mark it as the empire's territory.

Hone Heke a proud Ngapuhi leader was known for his fearsomeness as a powerful warrior amongst the clan however was also noted for his incredible intelligence and intellect.
Being the first Maori chief to sign the treaty of Waitangi Hone Heke spoke persuasively in favor of the treaty to his fellow Maori chiefs and people. 

However, after the treaty's signing, the aftermath of the event impacted the Maori, sending them into poverty. Laws such as “Land could only be held by individual owners” soon arrived killing off most Iwi and Hapu of their land ownership putting the British in favor of purchasing land Hone Heke acknowledged the wrong in his decision to sign the treaty and eventually wrote to the governor in protest of British authority in Maori affairs. The trigger of the widespread protest led by chief hone Heke was the British flag flying over Kororareka ( the flag had previously been removed by hone Heke fout times before the protest had begun ) chief Hone Heke’s first response to the growing power of the British was civil and wanted a peaceful agreement however after many letters of protest with no avail the war was unavoidable.

The war between the British and the Maori started with Hone Heke leading an attack on the flag post at Kororareka as an attempt to garner the attention of the governor in 1845 Hone Heke and his allies persisted with their attack on the flag post planning only to engage British troupes long enough to cut down the flag post one more time however this action was taken by the Pakeha as a declaration of war the British were led into eventual defeat realizing what formidable opponents they were up against the British made peace with the Maori coming to an agreement on the terms provided. 

Hone Heke passed away in august 1850 with his story passed down from generation to generation. Today he is known as the intelligent and fearless warrior that fought for his people giving new Zealanders the peace they enjoy today.
